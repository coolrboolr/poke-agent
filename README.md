# Poke-Streamer

Poke-Streamer is a real-time agentic framework designed to play PokÃ©mon games autonomously while streaming the gameplay to Twitch. The system is built around modular lanes that emulate different thinking speeds and strategies. An RL-based critic guides long-term improvement. The architecture aims for high observability and low latency, targeting a complete decision cycle under 16ms.

## Architecture Overview

|  Emulator    | -> | Perception       | -> | Memory / State   |
+--------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
        |                    |                    |
        v                    v                    v
+--------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
| Reflex Lane  |    | Tactical Lane    |    | Strategic Lane   |
+--------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
        \                    |                    /
         \                   v                   /

                             |
                             v
                      +--------------+
                      | RL Critic    |
                      +--------------+
                             |
                             v
                      +--------------+
                      | Twitch Stream|
                      +--------------+
```

- **Reflex Lane** reacts instantly to in-game events.
- **Tactical Lane** manages battle logic and short-term planning.
- **Strategic Lane** pursues long-term goals and exploration.
- **Arbiter** prioritizes actions from lanes based on urgency and context.
- **RL Critic** observes outcomes to provide rewards and improve policies.

All modules log their perceptions, decisions, and actions through a common logging utility so that developers can trace behavior easily.

## Building and Running with Docker

The project ships with a Docker setup for development and deployment. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

```bash
# Build the base image
docker compose build

# Start the stack with emulator and streaming components
docker compose up
```

The development container exposes a Python environment with required dependencies. ROM paths and Twitch credentials are supplied via environment variables loaded from `.env` or directly through Docker Compose secrets.

## Running Tests

Build the container image and open a shell inside it:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm app bash
```

Inside the container run:

```bash
python pytest.py -v
```

This ensures all dependencies are available when executing the test suite.

## Twitch Streaming Setup

Game output is streamed using `ffmpeg` or OBS inside the container. Configure your Twitch stream key in the environment variables:

```bash
TWITCH_STREAM_KEY=your_key_here
```

The streaming script captures frames from the emulator and pushes them to Twitch while the agent sends inputs. Low-latency settings are applied to keep the frame loop under 16ms.

## Developer Practices

- Read `the_plan.md` before contributing. All milestones and rules are defined there.
- Never merge incomplete stubs into `main`.
- All contributions must include tests and pass CI checks.
- Log every perception, decision, and action.
- Maintain performance and observability from the start.

### Logging Example

```python
logger.info("PERCEPT", extra={"frame_id": frame_id, "objects": objects})
logger.info("DECISION", extra={"lane": "tactical", "action": action})
logger.info("ACTION", extra={"input": button_press})
```

## Performance Constraints

The agent operates in a real-time loop targeting less than **16ms** per frame from perception to action. Each lane has its own budget but the combined processing must stay within this limit to maintain sync with the emulator.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your `.env` file with ROM paths and Twitch keys.
3. Run `docker compose up` to start development.
4. Read `agent.md` to understand lane behavior.

Happy streaming!

## Monitoring & Debugging

The `logs` directory stores runtime data including `loop_metrics.json` which
records average FPS and latency for the main loop. Structured logs appear on
stdout and can be colored when run in a terminal. For deeper inspection, run
`tools/frame_diagnose.py` to subscribe to the frame bus and optionally save
frames for offline review.
